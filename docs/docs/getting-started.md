# Getting started

**Chicane** is a **fully-typed router** for React and TypeScript.

## Design principles

- **Typed routes**, improving the DX, and making sure all your params are here!
- **Component-friendly**: the router nicely fits in your React app.
- **Easy-to-use**: naming routes instead of moving around unsafe URLs.
- **Performant**: avoids any unnecessary render.

## Install

```console
$ yarn add @swan-io/chicane
```

or

```console
$ npm install --save @swan-io/chicane
```
